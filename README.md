##  PURPOSE: ![img of application](https://github.com/murraiscanlon/group-project-calculator/blob/master/light-bulb32.png)
Flashcards may help students memorize terms and definitions, but Connection Cards help students understand concepts at a deeper level.
When presented with more than one term, the user is challenged to make a connection between the terms presented. If no connection can be made,
the user must explain why.
